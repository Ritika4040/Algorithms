best ,worst and average case analysis

1-linear search
2- binary search tree
now lets study linear search first

linear search
here is the list of an element and here you have to seach for key element 7
 
 8|6|12|5|9|7|4|3|16|18|
 0 1 2  3 4 5 6 7 8  9
 
 key = 7
 
 7 will be found in 6 seach
 
 now for key = 20
 20 is not there so not found
 
 here the best case is:
 if you are searching for a key and you found it in your first seach then its a best case like in above ex if the key was 8 then it is said to be the beat case.
 *searching key element preasent in first index.
 best case time = 1 O(1)
                  B(n)=O(1)

Worst case:
if you are searching for a key and you found it in your last seach then its a worst case like in above ex if the key was 18 it is said to be worst case.
* searching key element preasent in last index.
worst case time	= n		
                 w(n)= n	
                       O(n)

Average case - all possible case time/ no. of cases
*all the possible cases divide by number of cases 
avg time = 1+2+3+...+n/n = n(n+1)/2/n = n+1/2
           A(n)= n+1/2
            
B(n)=O(1)
W(n)=O(n)
A(n)=n+1/2	

Binary seach tree -

in binary seach tree smaller elements from the root goes on left side and bigger element then root goes on right side like a tree branchs. 

best case: 
if the element we are seaching is found on the root then its best case 
best case time- B(n)=1

worst case:
if the element we are seaching is found on the leaf then its worst case.
worst case time- w(n)=logn(depends on the height of the tree)
